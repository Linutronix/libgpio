libgpio
=======

libgpio can be used to ease the access of GPIOs via Linux / sysfs.

build
^^^^^
./autogen.sh
./configure && make && make install

also debian packages can be built:
./autogen.sh
dpkg-buildpackage

libgpio licensing rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
libgpio is provided under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 2.1 or later (LGPL-2.1-or-later), as provided in COPYING.

The libgpio examples are provided under the terms of the GNU General Public
License version 2.0 or later (GPL-2.0-or-later), as provided in COPYING.gpl.

This documentation file provides a description of how each source file
should be annotated to make its license clear and unambiguous.
It doesn't replace the libgpio license.

The common way of expressing the license of a source file is to add the
matching boilerplate text into the top comment of the file.  Due to
formatting, typos etc. these "boilerplates" are hard to validate for
tools which are used in the context of license compliance.

An alternative to boilerplate text is the use of Software Package Data
Exchange (SPDX) license identifiers in each source file.  SPDX license
identifiers are machine parsable and precise shorthands for the license
under which the content of the file is contributed.  SPDX license
identifiers are managed by the SPDX Workgroup at the Linux Foundation and
have been agreed on by partners throughout the industry, tool vendors, and
legal teams.  For further information see https://spdx.org/

libgpio requires the precise SPDX identifier in all source files.
The valid identifiers used in libgpio are explained in the section
`License identifiers`_ and have been retrieved from the official SPDX
license list at https://spdx.org/licenses/ along with the license texts.

License identifier syntax
-------------------------

1. Placement:

   The SPDX license identifier in kernel files shall be added at the first
   possible line in a file which can contain a comment.  For the majority
   or files this is the first line, except for scripts which require the
   '#!PATH_TO_INTERPRETER' in the first line.  For those scripts the SPDX
   identifier goes into the second line.

2. Style:

   The SPDX license identifier is added in form of a comment.  The comment
   style depends on the file type::

	C source: // SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>
	C header: /* SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression> */
	scripts:  # SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>

3. Syntax:

   A <SPDX License Expression> is either an SPDX short form license
   identifier found on the SPDX License List.

   License identifiers for licenses like [L]GPL with the 'or later' option
   are constructed by using a "-or-later" for indicating the 'or later'
   option.::

      // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later
      // SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-2.1-or-later

All SPDX license identifiers and exceptions must have a corresponding file,
like COPYING, COPYING.gpl, etc.
This is required to allow tool verification and to have the licenses ready
to read and extract right from the source, which is recommended by various
FOSS organizations, e.g. the `FSFE REUSE initiative
<https://reuse.software/>`_.
